This plugin monitors a file and displays its contens in gkrellm. File can have
multiple rows of the form 'name : value : [flag]'. If flag non-empty then
for WARNING value - the orange led will light up and for ALERT value - red.
For example
  CPU:50.8:ALERT
  SBr:33.4:WARNING
  Fan1:4560:
or
  Temp:31 C:
  Hum:49 %:

Plugin can monitor multiple files and for each file, you can specify
the following:
Label           - label of gkrellm panel
File to monitor - as is :) - file to monitor. It would be checked every 5 sec
Update program  - the program to update a monitored file.
Warning command - any shell command to run whenever warning flag is set.
Alert command   - any shell command to run whenever alert flag is set.

I'm using it to monitor my HW state from via686a sensor chip. For this purpose
I wrote sensors.tcl script that periodicaly run 'sensors' utility, processes
its output and writes results to ~/.sensors in the above format. 
sensors.tcl has its own documentation at the beginning of file.
Here is sensor's configuration
label <Sensors>
file <~/.sensors>
Update command <sensors.tcl>
Warning command  <mpg123 ~/mp3/cpu2hot.mp3>
Alert command  <sudo shutdown -h now>
